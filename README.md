## Edition Based Redefinition proof of concept

Set up database users, objects, and processes similar to those in IQPRODR and then see if we can use Edition Based Redefinition (EBR) to deploy new versions of the objects without downtime.

Some EBR links I've found quite helpful:
* Oracle 11.2 docs [Application development details](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e41502/adfns_editions.htm#ADFNS020)
* Oracle 11.2 docs [Managing Editions](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e25494/general.htm#ADMIN13166)
* Joe found this nice [demo](https://www.morganslibrary.org/reference/demos/ebr_demo1.html)
* Tim Hall wrote up [this doc](https://oracle-base.com/articles/11g/edition-based-redefinition-11gr2). It covers much of the same things as the other links; but with a bit more detail and explanations along the way.
